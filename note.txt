//Application-Level Middleware:
This type of middleware is applied to the entire server. It runs for every request made to the server, regardless of which route is being accessed.
2. Router-Level Middleware:
This middleware is applied only to specific routes. It runs only when a request is made to those particular routes, not for the entire server.
3. Built-in Middleware:
express.static: This middleware serves static assets like HTML files, CSS files, JavaScript files, images, etc. It allows you to serve these files directly to the client from the server.
express.json: This middleware parses incoming requests that have a JSON payload. It reads the JSON data sent in the request body and makes it accessible as req.body in your route handlers.
express.urlencoded: This middleware parses incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads, typically from HTML form submissions. It decodes the data sent in the request body and makes it available as req.body in your route handlers.
